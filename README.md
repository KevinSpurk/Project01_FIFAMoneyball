# 1 Project Description

In the project, I use a dataset from the game FIFA21, that contains data of ca. 17.000 football players, listing a variety of information for them, such as club, wage, different scores for their skills and many more.


### 1.1 Objectives

Building a linear regression model that predicts the players market value as accurate as possible. Moreover I want to answer the following 3 questions:

1. How much does the prediction quality vary in relation to the value? E.g. is there a trend of the model getting worse the higher the value is?
2. Which field position has the highest average value?
3. How many players have a maximum overall score?


### 1.2 Dataset

FIFA21 data set of male players [**fifa21_male2.csv**](https://github.com/Ironhack-Data-0621-Remote/Project_FIFA_MoneyBall/tree/main/Data).

The data set includes:

 **EA Sports FIFA 21 Game** data:

    |   |   |
    |---|---|
    |  Player Name | Club of the Player   |
    | League  | Position  |
    | Pace  |  Shooting |
    |  Passing | Dribbling  |
    | Defending|Physical|
    |||
